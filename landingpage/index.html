    <h1>About India</h1>
    <p id="About">According to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name "India" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east. In turn the name "India" derived successively from Hellenistic Greek India, ancient Greek Indos , Old Persian Hindush (an eastern province of the Achaemenid Empire), and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or "river", specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin. The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi ,which translates as "The people of the Indus"</p>

    <h1>Some Cool Stories</h1>

      <p>Small Hindu temples and shrines are scattered around the country, along the highway, and in the smallest villages. In the holiest city of India alone, in Varanasi, at the river Ganga, there are 3000 temples. Religious festivals and visiting temples make up most of the free time for Indians. The majority of Indians are Hindus, but with 12-13% of the population being Muslims, Islam is the second biggest religion in India. There are 2 million Hindu temples and 300 000 mosques in India. </p>
        <p>In 2014, the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the “Clean India” (“Swachh Bharat”) sanitation program to make the country cleaner and to improve general hygiene with a focus on building toilets all over the country. Before that, only 4 out of 10 households in the countryside had toilets. Of course, it was not enough to build toilets. They had to change the general mindset and behavior too. But they declared the program a big success. According to the official statistics, more than 60.000 toilets were built per day. As part of the campaign, wherever you go in India, “Clean India Green India” drawings and slogans decorate the walls.</p>
          <p>In India, it is more favorable to have a son than a daughter. The reason behind this is simple. To have a daughter is a big financial burden since the families of the bride have traditionally been expected to provide the dowry for the groom’s family. Earlier, if the family failed to provide the promised dowry, the groom took revenge by an acid attack or any other way that destroyed the girl’s life for a lifetime. Although the Indian laws prohibit to demand dowry now, it still happens, just arranged more discretely. </p>
